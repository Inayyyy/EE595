To obtain results of all questions, type "bash Lab8_partI_3973887764.sh" in the terminal.
For problem 1,2,3,5, since output format is not specified, I simply write accepted lines to output[0-6].txt, and discard those rejected lines.

Problem 1: 
To write line 4, I refer to section "Binary numbers divisible by 3" in https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/designing-finite-automata-from-regular-expression-set-1/

Problem 4:
To use sed, I refer to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sed-command-in-linux-unix-with-examples/ for help.
In order to keep the ee_classes.html intact, I copy the content of it to another html file called test.html.

Problem 5:
As the input3.txt shown, the code should be well indented.

Problem 6:
To output VALID/INVALID, which is not included in input file, I use a while loop to read file line by line and if-else statement to output properly.
