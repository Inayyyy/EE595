## Instructions
- To run this program correctly, make sure the train image file and input.txt are under the same directory as kmeans.py.
- Type ```kmeans.py N flag``` where N stands for the number of train images and flag determines the initial centroids (flag = 1 means reading centroids from input.txt, flag = 0 means selecting centroids from train images) to run this program.
- result.txt contains the label of each image.
- Note: To read image from MNIST dataset, I referred to [this blog](https://blog.csdn.net/u013597931/article/details/80099243).
