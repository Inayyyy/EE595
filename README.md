# EE595
This repository includes all code I write for EE595 (start from Lab4)

## Lab4
In this lab, practice Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ and algorithms including sort, linear search and binary search.

## Lab 5
This lab focuses on the following practice: 

1) Recursion; 2) OOP, including constructors/destructors; 3) Dynamic memory allocation.

## Lab 6
To run K-means correctly, please download and unzip [train-images.idx3-ubyte](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html) to the part2 directory.

In this lab, I implemented linear least squares and K-means by my own instead of using python packages.
