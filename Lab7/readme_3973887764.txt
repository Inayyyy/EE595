Part 1: Use PCA and Implement KNN
To run the code, use command "python knn_3973887764.py K D N PATH_TO_DATA". (Example: python knn_3973887764.py 5 100 960 ./cifar-10-batches-py/data_batch_1)
This problem uses dataset from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Part 2: Naive Bayes
To run this program, use command "python naive_bayes_3973887764.py". Remember to put seeds_dataset.txt under the same directory where the python file sits
To write line 15, I refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57364197/how-to-initialize-numpy-array-of-list-objects. 
To write line 36, I refer to https://medium.com/@rrfd/what-is-maximum-likelihood-estimation-examples-in-python-791153818030.
In addition to self-implemented naive bayes, I use tools provided by sklearn, including Sklearn Naive Bayes, SVC, Decision Tree.
Other notes:
    Training time:
        Start time: after I read and processed row data
        End time: once I got all Gaussian normal model parameters
    Testing time:
        Start time: once I start using model parameters to predict label for test set
        End time: when the prediction for test set ends
